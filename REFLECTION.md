## 1. Where did you struggle the most?
> Handling click events + showing modal state. Also debugging useEffect race conditions.

## 2. Step-by-step debugging?
> Used `console.log`, isolated the component, simplified fetch logic, and gradually reintroduced states. Also read MDN/React docs for `useEffect` + closure quirks.

## 3. Peeked at sample repo?
> Yes, checked it for modal logic. I learned how to conditionally render components + avoid unnecessary re-renders.

## 4. What would you improve?
> Add routing with React Router to allow sharing links to each Pok√©mon!
